#REDIRECT [[SELECT CASE#allCASES]]

[[CASE ELSE]] is used in a [[SELECT CASE]] procedure as an alternative if no other [[CASE]] statements are true. 


{{PageDescription}}
* [[CASE ELSE]] should be listed at the bottom of the case list as it will supersede any case statements after it.
* Use it as a &quot;safety net&quot; or as an alternative for all values not covered in the [[CASE]] statements.
