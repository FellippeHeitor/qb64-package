The [[GOTO]] statement sends the procedure to a line label or a line number in the program.


{{PageSyntax}} 
: [[GOTO]] {''lineNumber''|''lineLabel''}


'''''IF''' Syntax:''
: IF condition [[GOTO]] {''lineNumber''|''lineLabel''}


{{PageDescription}}
* ''lineNumber'' or ''lineLabel'' must already exist or an [[IDE]] status error will be displayed until it is created.
* Can be used in [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedures using their own line labels or numbers.
* The frequent use of GOTO statements can become confusing when trying to follow the code and it could also cause endless loops.
* [[GOTO]] is an easy trap for new programmers. Use loops instead when possible.


{{PageExamples}}
''Example:''
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
1 {{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;first line&quot;: {{Cl|GOTO}} gohere
2 {{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;second line&quot;: {{Cl|GOTO}} 3

gohere:
{{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;third line&quot;
{{Cl|GOTO}} 2

3 {{Cl|END}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
first line
third line
second line
{{OutputEnd}}

:''Explanation:'' After it prints &quot;first line&quot; it goes to the line label &quot;gohere&quot; where it prints &quot;third line&quot;, then it goes to the line that is numbered &quot;2&quot; and prints &quot;second line&quot; and goes to line number 3 and an [[END]] statement which ends the program.
